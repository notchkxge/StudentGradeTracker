# StudentGradeTracker

A C# .NET console application demonstrating SQLite database initialization, table creation, and schema design for a student grade management system. This project focuses on foundational database skills and SQL integration.

## What's Included

**Database Initialization**: Automatically creates a SQLite database file (`students.db`) on first run.
- **Schema Design**: Defines three relational tables:
  - `Students` (StudentId, Name, Email)
  - `Courses` (CourseId, CourseName)
  - `Grades` (GradeId, StudentId, CourseId, GradeValue) with foreign keys
- **SQL Execution**: Uses raw SQL commands via ADO.NET to create tables.

# What I Learned
**SQL Syntax**: Writing `CREATE TABLE` statements with `PRIMARY KEY`, `FOREIGN KEY`, and data types.
**Database Debugging**: Using DB Browser for SQLite to validate table schemas.
**C# Integration**: 
  - Initializing SQLite databases programmatically
  - Executing SQL commands from a .NET application
**OOP Basics**: Creating `Student`, `Course`, and `Grade` model classes.
**Git Fundamentals**: Committing incremental progress and resolving branch conflicts.
